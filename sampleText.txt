International Workers' Day, also known as International Labour Day, is celebrated across the globe on May 1. The day is set aside in honour of workers and labourers across industries and sectors. The objective of the day is not only to celebrate the contribution of workers but also to empower them to understand their rights.
In several countries, Labour Day is also a national holiday with many organisations backing special campaigns for the betterment of their employees.

Origin

The origin of Labour Day can be traced back to the United States of America in the 19th Century. May 1 in particular was chosen as the date to mark Labour Day to commemorate the nationwide strike for an eight-hour day in 1886 that began on May 1 and ended as the Haymarket affair in Chicago US.
